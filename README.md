## Game rules

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by preventing the light around the player from going out. To do this, you must collect candlesticks that appear randomly in the room to restore the player's light. In addition, you must also escape the ghosts that appear during the game.

## Controls

You can move the player by using the `arrows keys` on your keyboard.
